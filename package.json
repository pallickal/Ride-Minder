  "description": "Track your fuel economy. Set a maintenance schedule, and receive reminders when due. Document repairs and service. Plan broader upgrades with a build sheet - showing detailed notes (text and photographs), costs broken down, along with part model/category specific bookmarks for saving useful information like forum posts/vendors. When parts of a build sheet are completed, they are conveniently entered into the build history for a vehicle. Track individual vehicle costs broken down by parts of a build, routine maintenance, repairs, or re-fueling. You may attach photos of receipts to any of these records as documentation.",
